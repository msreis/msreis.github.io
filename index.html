  <h5> Welcome! </h5>
  
  The Dynamic Systems Biology Group, led by <a href="members.html#msreis">Marcelo S. Reis</a> and hosted at the Cell Cycle Laboratory, <a href="http://butantan.gov.br/instituto-butantan/about-us" target="_blank">Butantan Institute</a>, is a team of scientists whose main goal the development of cutting-edge Bayesian Model Selection and Machine Learning techniques and their application into the modeling of biological systems, with emphasis to their underlying dynamic mechanisms. Currently, we are focused on two research lines: the modeling of cell signaling pathways in the context of cancer biology and the deciphering of the DNA replication dynamics in protozan.

      <h5>Modeling of cell signaling pathways in the context of cancer biology</h5>
    </div>
     <div class="row">
    Cancer cells proliferate relentlessly, partly due to deregulation of several cell signaling pathways. Once there are technical limitations in wet lab screening procedures, dynamic modeling of signaling pathways is an important tool to predict molecular and ultimately cell phenotype response following cellular stimuli or chemical species perturbations (e.g., protein inhibition or activation). Therefore, our group investigates novel methods to model, using systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), highly-predictive cell signaling pathways, focusing on both mitogenic and stress-mitigation pathways, which are relevant for cancer cell phenotype. One of our current projects in this research line is "<a href="projects.html#Goldilocks">Finding the "Goldilocks zones" of cell signaling pathways in cancer therapy</a>", which is carried out in collaboration with Prof. Hugo Armelin (Coordinator of the FAPESP RIDC CeTICS center), Dr. Juliane Liepe (Group Leader at Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Germany), Prof. Junior Barrera (Director of Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, University of São Paulo) and Prof. Ronaldo Hashimoto (Associate Professor at Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, University of São Paulo).

      <h5>Deciphering of the DNA replication dynamics in trypanosomatids</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
    Among the Eukaryota domain, the protozoan are comprised of single-celled organisms that might be either free-living or parasitic. The trypanosomatids fit in the latter category, with many clinically relevant species, such as <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> (pathogen that causes the Chagas disease) and <em>T. brucei</em> (responsible for the sleeping sickness). Once there is no known cure for the diseases caused by those parasites, the study of their biology is a subject of immediate biomedical interest. In this regard, once those parasites alternate between replicative and non-replicative forms, the study of their DNA replication dynamics is a relevant topic. However, those organisms have a peculiar genomic organization, with their genes arranged into polycistronic clusters and the presence of constitutive transcription along the whole cell cycle. Those genomic properties yield a DNA replication dynamics in those biological systems that is not directly comparable to higher eukaryotes (e.g., mammalian cells). Therefore, in this research line, we propose the designing, data-based calibration and simulation of stochastic dynamic models of the DNA replication dynamics of trypanosomatids. We are particularly interested in the impact of the conflicts between DNA replication and transcription machineries on the DNA replication programming of those parasites. Presently we have in this research line the project "<a href="projects.html#replicationModels">Stochastic models of DNA replication programming in trypanosomatids</a>", which is carried out in collaboration with Dr. Maria Carolina Elias (Director of Cell Cycle Laboratory, Butantan Institute).

        <figcaption class="caption"><i>An example with two replication origins (theta 1 and theta 2) of how our dynamic model simulates the replication-transcription conflicts in <em>T. brucei</em>. When we simulate replication and transcription at the same time, if there is a head-to-head collision between replication and transcription machineries (replisome and RNA polymerase, respectively), then the replication fork collapses, leading to an unbinding of its respective replisome and the involved RNAP.
